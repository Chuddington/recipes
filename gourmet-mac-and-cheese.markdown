## Ingredients

 * 1 lb uncooked spiral tube-shaped pasta
 * 1 teaspoon olive oil
 * 2 tablespoons butter
 * 1/4 cup flour
 * 2 cups whole milk
 * 1 cup whipping cream
 * 3 cups grated cheddar cheese
 * 1 1/2 cups crumbled blue cheese, divided (Maytag or Danish)
 * salt & freshly ground black pepper or tricolor pepper, to taste
 * 1 dash cayenne, to taste (optional)
 * 1 1/2 tablespoons minced fresh chives


## Directions

 * Preheat oven to 350 degrees F; butter a 13x9x2-inch glass baking dish.
 * Cook the pasta according to package directions until tender but still firm to bite, stirring occasionally; drain and set aside (about 8 minutes).
 * While the pasta is cooking, in a large heavy saucepan over medium low heat, melt the olive oil and butter together; add the flour and, stirring constantly, cook for 1 minute (don't let it brown), then gradually whisk in the milk and cream.
 * Simmer mixture until it slightly thickens, whisking occasionally, for 3 minutes.
 * Reduce the temperature to low, then gradually stir in the grated cheddar and 1 cup of the blue cheese and cook, stirring, until the cheese melts.
 * Season to taste with salt, freshly ground pepper, and cayenne (if using).
 * Stir in the cooked pasta, making sure it's well-coated with the sauce.
 * Pour mixture into the buttered baking dish, sprinkle with the reserved 1/2 cup crumbled blue cheese, and bake at 350 degrees F for 30 minutes.
 * Sprinkle with the minced chives and serve.

Note: also good with a serving of carmelized onions and sauteed mushrooms; also, you can use 2% or skim milk instead of whole, but using whole is how they make it at the restaurant.


## My thoughts

I make this for Christmas Eve, being the venerated appetizer / snack holiday that it is on my dad's side of the family. I doubled the recipe, and added everyone's favorite: bacon. Put some bacon in the cheese mix and leave some for the top so people know what they are getting into. I have used a jar of the precooked Hormel bacon and it has worked out fine. I used the cayenne (just a bit) and maybe some paprika for flavor/color. I think I usually end up with 1 gorgonzola and 2 blue cheeses, and a variety of orange cheeses to total 6 cups.
